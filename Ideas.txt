Energy Crystal Power Core
An 5x5x2 multi-block structure. This structure can generate an enormous amount of 
power(1TW of power at 1million Volts)
ECP core has 4 states:
Idle		- This is when the generator is doing nothing
Generate	- This is what you expect when the generator is producting energy
Overload	- This state is when the generator is over working. If it stays in this state 
			  too long the generator will explode taking your base out with it. At lest 
			  a large chunk of it.
Vent		- Vent out and cool off the generator to prevent an explostion

This structure requires a Power Core Controller to operate.

Energy Crystal Power Core Controller
This is a TileEntity that controls the ECP core. You can make the core overload idle and 
vent. Also this can be locked out and only be controlled from the Computer Core or CC.

Computer Core
A multi-block structure that acts as a central control system for your base. It can store
who you want to access your doors, forcefield doors, ECP core controller, and Matter Forge. 
You can setup it so that one person can only access 4 doors and one force field but nothing 
else. Another as an intruder so that any combat system will automaticly target them and 
attempt to kill him/her. This stucture is also where your self-disctruct is setup at by 
overloading your ECP core. Takes 10KW at 960v

Automatic Door/BlastDoor - 4x3, 4x4, 5x4 sturctures.
This is a multi-block structure door. It requires some power to operate. It's controlled 
by a Door Controller and powered by a power regulator. 5KW at 480v

Force Field Door - 1x8 with a 8m space between the two sturctures.
A multi-block sturcture that can generate a force field between two emitter sturctures. One of
the sturctures require a power regulator and a FF controller to operate. Needs a large amount 
of power to operate. Takes 10KW at 960v

Oil Drilling Rig
A multi-block structure that drills down to bedrock to where the vast and inifinite resavores 
of oil lies. Takes 25KW at 1040v

Energy Busway
Conductive pathway for 1TW at 1,000,000v.
This conductor can only contect to a junction box or a power regulator. It can not connect 
to it self or to any other cable.

Energy Cable
Cunductive pathway for 50KW at 2000v. This cable can connect to anything excepct Busway.

Data Cable
Connects controllers to the computer core and can connect to CC computers.

Utility Busway Bundle(Busway + Data Cable)
This cable is the same as the Energy busway but it also has a data cable bundled with it.

Junction Box
This box contect energy busways to cables. Also can connect to any other mod's 
cables(IC2,buildcraft,UE api cables)
